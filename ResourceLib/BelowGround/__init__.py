"""
Sub-library containing below-ground resource modules.

The library is divided into three sections:
- **Individual**: Modules that work with single plants
- **Network**: Modules that create groups of plants that work as a unit, e.g. by root grafting.
- **Generic**: Modules that do not represent an own module, but are helpers or modules to use pyMANGA externally.
